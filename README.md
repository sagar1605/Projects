Breast cancer poses a significant health risk for women, resulting in elevated morbidity and mortality rates. Nevertheless, the lack of robust prognosis models has made it challenging for medical professionals to develop effective treatment plans.
To address this critical issue, our project aimed to develop predictive techniques that minimize errors and enhance diagnostic accuracy. We compared the performance of deep learning transfer learning with the VGG16 and RESNET 50 models using Confusion Matrices for both algorithms. We executed all experiments in a simulated environment within the Google Colab platform, utilizing diverse datasets.
Our approach involved sequential forward selection-based feature selection and leveraging the VGG16 and RESNET 50 models for feature extraction. By analyzing parameters such as smoothness_area and text_area in mammography images, our goal was to differentiate between benign and malignant breast tumors. Notably, our study produced outstanding results, with the highest overall accuracy reaching 89% using the VGG16 model.
This project represents a significant step towards improving breast cancer diagnosis accuracy. Future research avenues could explore additional parameters, potentially categorizing breast cancer research based on various other factors.
